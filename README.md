Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) have become a standard laboratory tool to study population-wide electrophysiology. However, the amount of data generated by this technique requires a specialized pipeline to extract relevant biological meaning. 

In this hands-on, we will go over said pipeline, including spike detection, data visualization, extracting overall population-wide parameters, population burst analysis, and spatial analysis of activity. The different steps will be implemented in MATLAB, where the students will have the chance to create their own functions based on the theoretical rationale behind each step, or study already built functions that will be provided.

Goals: To expose the students to the logic behind MEA data analysis, so they can independently implement this pipeline with their data. Familiarize students with programming environments and code organization. Understanding what biological information can be extracted from each analysis.
